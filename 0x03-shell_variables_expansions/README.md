In this project, we learn about shell variables and how to expand an expression using special characters. There are preset variables that can be global or local and we can create our own variables using a certain command. With expanding an expression, we learn that the shell expands our command input before giving the output. On top of that, we also learn how to use expression expansion to do various expansions, such as arithmetic expansion. We learn what shell initialization files are as well. They are the files that, when invoked, will load your shell up with your saved settings, customizing your shell's environment to your preferences.
